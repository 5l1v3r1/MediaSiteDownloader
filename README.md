# MediaSiteDownloader
A proof of concept for a chrome extension that can download MediaSite lectures as mp4 files. It has only been tested against tue's setup and will not work for all MediaSite instances (yet?)

## Installation
* Clone this github repo or download it as a zip
* Go to chrome > more tools > extensions and enable Developer mode
* Select "Load unpacked" and navigate to the home dir of this repo
